<h4><a name="port">proxy.port=9999</a></h4>

Port which the Sahi proxy server uses.<br>
This should be the same as used in the browser proxy settings.

<h4><a name="#hotkey">Hot Key</a></h4>

When the Hot Key is pressed and the page is doubleclicked, the Sahi
Controller window is displayed.<br>
By default, the Hot Key is set to ALT.<br>
If ALT does not work on your platform, you could configure the
hotkey in this file. <br>
The hot key could be any one of ALT, SHIFT or CTRL keys. <br>
Note that popup blockers may prevent the Controller window from
coming up.<br>
So first turn off popup blockers on your browser.<br>
Sometimes CTRL-ALT-DblClick works on some browsers since that
temporarily turns off some blockers.<br>
