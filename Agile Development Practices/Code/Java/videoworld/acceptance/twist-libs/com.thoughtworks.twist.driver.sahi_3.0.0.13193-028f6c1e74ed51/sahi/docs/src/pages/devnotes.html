<h4><a name="basics">How does Sahi work?</a></h4>

Sahi's core parts include the <span class="code">Sahi proxy
server</span> and the <span class="code">javascript
engine</span><br>
 <img src="sahi_architecture.gif"><br>
Html responses which pass through the proxy are modified such that
javascript is injected at the start and end of the response.<br>
This will allow the browser to record and playback scripts and talk
back to the proxy when needed.<br>
<br>
 Apart from handling requests for pages that the browser requests,
<br>
Sahi also handles custom commands related to recording, playback
etc. which the browser sends.<br>
 <br>
<br>

<h4><a name="delayed">How does the script in sah files
execute?</a></h4>

The Sahi script, even though looking like javascript, is not
executed as regular javascript on the browser.<br>
The reasons for this are: 

<ul>
<li>The script refers to objects spread over multiple pages and
will result in errors if executed directly on any page</li>

<li>The script needs to be executed step by step with a slight
delay between execution of each step.<br>
This cannot be accomplished directly since javascript has no way of
pausing execution.</li>
</ul>

Sahi handles this by parsing and modifying the script in the
proxy.<br>
<br>
Thus, a line which looked like this:<br>
<pre class="code">
_click(_link("Link Test"));
</pre>

<br>
gets translated to:<br>
<pre class="code">
sahiAdd("sahi_click(sahi_link(\"Link Test\"));", "sahi_demo.sah : 3")
</pre>

<br>
<br>
 The method sahiAdd(cmd, debugInfo) takes two parameters.<br>
The first is the line of script, which has been converted into a
string.<br>
The second is debug information which the proxy adds.<br>
<pre>
function sahiAdd(cmd, debugInfo){
    var i = _sahiCmds.length;
  _sahiCmds[i] = cmd;
  _sahiCmdDebugInfo[i] = debugInfo;
}
</pre>

During page load, <a href="apis.html#scheduler">Scheduler
Functions</a> add steps in the script to an array.<br>
A counter is maintained on the server which marks the index in the
array of the step that is to be run next.<br>
This counter is updated with each successful execution of a
step.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<hr>
<br>
 

<h4><a name="variable">Why do variables need to be prefixed with a
dollar($) sign?</a></h4>

When variables are used, the transformation of script is as
follows:<br>
<pre class="code">
var $linkText = "Link Test";
_click(_link($linkText));
</pre>

<br>
becomes<br>
<pre class="code">
var $linkText = "Link Test";
sahiAdd("sahi_click(sahi_link("+s_v($linkText)+"));", "sahi_demo.sah : 4");
</pre>

<br>
 

<pre>
function s_v(v){
    var type = typeof v;
    if (type == "number") return v;
    else if (type == "string") return "\""+v+"\"";
    else return v;
}
</pre>

Thus, what will eventually execute, will be:<br>
<pre class="code">
sahi_click(sahi_link("Link Test"));
</pre>

<br>
For easy identifcation of variables while parsing, it is needed
that there is some way of tagging variables. <br>
The dollar($) sign serves that purpose.<br>
 <br>
<br>

<br>
 

<h4><a name="underscore">Why do all Sahi APIs start with an
underscore?</a></h4>

Sahi scripts are loaded with each page that appears on the
browser.<br>
Since it is all javascript, the API function names need to be
unique.<br>
If the application under test has a function with the same name, it
can cause problems. <br>
For this, all API functions start with "sahi_".<br>
 When Sahi's proxy serves the script to the browser, it parses and
does a lot of modifications to the script.<br>
One of these is to correctly replace the API methods starting with
"_" with "sahi_". <br>
<br>
Thus, 

<pre class="code">
_click(_link("Create Login"));
</pre>

<br>
actually becomes <br>
 

<pre class="code">
sahi_click(sahi_link("Create Login"));
</pre>

<br>
Starting the APIs with "_" helps in easy substitution with "sahi_"
with less scope for ambiguity.<br>
