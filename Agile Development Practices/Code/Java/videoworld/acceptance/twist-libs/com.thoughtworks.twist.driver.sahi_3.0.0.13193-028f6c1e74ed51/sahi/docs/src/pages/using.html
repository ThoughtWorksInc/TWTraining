<h4><a name="started">Getting started</a></h4>

<b>Starting Sahi:</b><br>
<p>Windows:<br>
    - Go to &lt;sahi_root&gt;\bin and run sahi.bat<br>
    Linux<br>
    - Go to &lt;sahi_root&gt;/bin and run sahi.sh<br>
    Note that by default Sahi uses port 9999. This can be modified
    through <a href="props.html">sahi.properties</a></p>

<br>
<b>Configuring the browser:</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Firefox:</b><br>
<ul type="square">
    <li>Go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; General &gt; Connection Settings
        &gt;</li>

    <li>Set to "Manual Proxy Configuration"</li>

    <li>Set "HTTP Proxy" to "localhost"</li>

    <li>Set "Port" to "9999". (This setting can be modified through
        &lt;sahi_root&gt;/config/<a href=
            "props.html">sahi.properties</a>)</li>

    <li>Do the same for "SSL Proxy" too, if you wish to record and playbacl https sites</li>

    <li>Keep "Use the same proxy for all protocol" unchecked as Sahi
        does not understand protocols other than HTTP</li>

    <li>NOTE: "No Proxy for" should NOT have localhost in it.</li>
</ul>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Internet Explorer:</b><br>
<ul type="square">
    <li>Go to Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Connections &gt; LAN
        Settings &gt;</li>

    <li>In "Proxy server" section, Check "Use a proxy server for your
        LAN"</li>

    <li>Set "Address" to "localhost"</li>

    <li>Set "Port" to "9999"</li>

    <li>Leave "Bypass proxy server for local addresses" unchecked</li>

    <li>OK &gt; OK : )</li>
</ul>

While working with Sahi it may become annoying to have to switch
between proxy and no proxy, or to another proxy.<br>
There are a few plugins/freeware available on the net to ease
this.<br>
My personal favorite while working on Firefox is "Proxy Button". It
helps in a single click toggling of proxy.<br>
These tools can considerably enhance the experience of using
Sahi.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a name="demo">Starting the bundled demo web server if needed,
    for learning and understanding Sahi APIs:</a></b><br>
Windows:<br>
- Go to &lt;sahi_root&gt;\bin and run web.bat<br>
Linux<br>
- Go to &lt;sahi_root&gt;/bin and run web.sh<br>
Go to url http://localhost:10000/demo/index.htm and play around
with the different pages.<br>
It gives a fair idea of how elements are accessed through Sahi.<br>
<br>
Note that by default Sahi uses port 9999 and the web server uses
port 10000 (sahi's port + 1). <br>
These can be modified through <a href=
        "props.html">sahi.properties</a> <br>
(<a href="#top">Top</a>) <br>
<h4><a name="record">Recording through Sahi</a></h4>

<ul type="square">
    <li>Press <a href="props.html#hotkey">ALT</a> and double click on
        the window which you want to record.</li>

    <li>On the popup that appears, give a name for the script you wish
        to generate, and click 'Record'</li>

    <li>Most actions on the page will now get recorded.</li>

    <li>Moving the mouse over any html element while pressing Ctrl key
        will show the javascript accessor info in the popup.</li>

    <li>Clicking the "Add Assertions" button generates assertions for
        the element. These assertions can be added to the script by
        clicking "Add to Script"</li>
</ul>

The script being generated can be viewed by opening the
&lt;script_name&gt;.sah file in the scripts directory.<br>
The script can be edited even while recording, so that logical
segregation into functions etc. can be done as recording
happens.<br>


<ul type="square">
    <li>Once done, click stop.</li>
</ul>

Note that custom code can be tested, by entering code in the
"debug" textarea and clicking on "Test -&gt;". <br>
The command will be executed and the result will be displayed in
the textbox near the "Test -&gt;" button.<br>
Once confirmed that the desired result has been achieved, that code
snippet can be added to the recording by clicking "Append to
Recording"<br>
<br>

Sahi to get your feet wet.<br>

    <li>Or go to the "[from url]" section and specify the full url of
        the script file. (eg.

    <li>Click 'Set'.</li>
