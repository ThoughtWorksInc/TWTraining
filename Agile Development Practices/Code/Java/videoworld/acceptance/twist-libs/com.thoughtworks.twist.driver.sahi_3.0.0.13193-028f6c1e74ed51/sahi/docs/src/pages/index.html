<!--Introduction-->
Sahi is an automation and testing tool for web applications, with
the facility to record and playback scripts.<br>
Developed in java and javascript, this tool uses simple javascript
to execute events on the browser. <br>
Features include, in-browser controls, text based scripts, ant
support for playback of suites of tests,<br>
and multi threaded playback. It supports HTTP and HTTPS.<br>
 <br>
 Sahi runs as a proxy server and the browser needs to use the sahi
server as its proxy.<br>
Sahi then injects javascript so that it can access elements in the
webpage.<br>
This makes the tool independent of the website/ web
application.<br>
